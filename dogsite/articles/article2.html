        <h1>Cruelty against animals are incresing now a days</h1>

        <p>Fighter is an Indian Stray dog who became a victim of a hit and run accident on the streets when he was barely one year old. Many street pups die at a young age in accidents like these. He was lucky one who survived but with massive damage to his brain. This is his rescue story.
            <br><br>
            Fighter suffered a stage 3 head trauma. He was comatose for a long duration as he had brain hemorrhage and edematous. Due to the intensity of the trauma, he had anatomical skull deformity and reduction of vision. The rescuer rushed him to VOSD Grantee Karma Foundation in Pune. With the efforts of the Karma team and his will to recover, Fighter made an amazing recovery against all odds. Karma Foundation team never gives up on any dog that comes to them for treatment. Whether it is running to take opinion of the best vets in the country to even vets abroad, the Karma team does their best to get the most effective treatment for stray dogs and cats in their care.
            <br><br>
            <b>Road to recovery is not easy</b><br><br>
            Fighter had to go through multiple blood tests, X-rays, pain assessment tests and ocular examinations. Due to the massive trauma, he has suffered a permanent brain damage. His mental development is restricted, and his behavioral patterns are that of a puppy. His ocular and hearing centers are damaged up to 80% hence he has limited vision and hearing.
            <br><br>
            His cerebellum has also sustained damage leading to in-coordination and posture issues.He barks at walls sometimes because he does not know what is in front of him. His sense of smell is strong. His vision is affected. He cannot see far and does not follow sounds to respond when called.
            <br><br>
            <b>Life at vosd</b><br><br>
            Fighter is a big sized dog and requires lots of open space to live his life happily and channelize his energy. Karma Foundation is a primarily medical facility and they do not have the space or resources needed for lifelong care of a dog like Fighter. So, they approached VOSD to surrender Fighter.
            <br><br>
            Fighter came to VOSD with 2 other dogs from Karma â€“ the Blind girl Bella and the Mumma dog with severe hind leg deformity. They were driven from Pune and reached VOSD late at night. He was very scared the first few days but soon the magic of VOSD touched him too. From a scared dog who did not know which direction to move and what to do, he has now become some sort of a gang leader here for smaller dogs. He runs and instigates them to follow and play with him! His best friend and follower is a dog called Calendar.
            <br><br>
            Fighter has a large yard for him to run and play throughout the day, trees to rest under and a house to get into when he feels like it. He knows his mealtimes well and eats very well. He has become happier since coming to VOSD.</p>
