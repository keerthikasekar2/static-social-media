        <h1>Cruelty against animals are incresing now a days</h1>
        <h5>2023-09-13 15:43:10 | by siva</h5>
        <p>The world has largely been at odds with civilization recently. Nature, our environment, human activities are all elements of a co-existing instinct for survival, whatever be the myriad of speculating reasons behind this instinct- philosophically or scientifically. And our coexistence is threatened when even a single branch of our biosphere is tampered with. Same is the case with cruelty to animals.<br><br>

            An appalling fact- animal cruelty- unfortunately is a distressing reality. There are reports of animal abuse inflicted on pets, street animals, forest-dwelling animals and such. Marine wildlife conservation is a significant cause too. According to reports, 13% of animal abuse involves domestic violence. 3 to 4 million cats and dogs (young, healthy and adoptable) are euthanized every year in shelters. These staggering statistics shed notable light on the cases of domestic violence towards animals and pets.<br><br>
            
            One of the main points, repeatedly highlighted, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been the need to stay indoors. Consequently, incidents of offending nature in abusive households have been on the rise.<br><br>
            
            <b>Pets at risk of domestic violence </b>  <br><br>
            As the people worldwide are shut in inside their homes, domestic violence is not only prevalent amongst humans, but it is also a disturbing infliction on pets and animals. What makes the situation grimmer is that, unlike the humans, animals do not receive due importance and precedence in cases of negligence and cruelty towards them.<br>
            
            <b>Unfair behaviour towards animals</b><br><br>
            
            A recent news report cites residents of apartment buildings having to face unfair terms and conditions during the pandemic. Community associations and committees have imposed bans on keeping pets, feeding of strays, preventing pets from using common amenities, animal feeders being harassed and abused. A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed by the complainants.<br>
            
            There have also been instances of pet desertion, attacks on community dogs and cats and the like. Please adopt a pet only if you are capable of keeping care of them. Abandoning pets and attacking stray animals on misplaced conceptions and beliefs that they might transmit diseases, especially in a time of a pandemic, should not be the case. Global health organisations have invalidated theories of animals around us being carriers of the coronavirus.<br><br>
            
             <b>Dealing with cruelty to animals</b><br><br>
            
            It can be discouraging and disheartening to not see effectual action being taken against the offenders, as is many a time the case. To ensure that appropriate action is taken, it is always a fit practice to inform and follow through with the authorities and law enforcement to make sure that a case is made. In India, several animal protection laws under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the IPC ensure that just action is taken against the perpetrators. Read this comprehensive article on animal protection laws to have an overview.

            <ul>
                 <li>Get veterinary care- The foremost objective should be the aid that an animal receives. Make sure that the animal in distress gets the proper veterinary care. Contact local veterinarians or animal welfare groups so that the care is facilitated.</li>
                 <li>Document the crime- For future reference which might help for lawful consideration, take a photo or video with your cell phone to document the details if you can, and be sure to capture important information such as license plate numbers and a visual of the abuser.</li>
                 <li>File a first information report (FIR) with the police immediately- Informing the authorities so that appropriate steps are taken for curtailing future incidents by the offender is imperative. If the authorities are somehow inconsiderate, file a grievance with the description of the incident with the Animal Welfare Board of India.</li>
                 <li>Thank the people who helped- Share the story of successful action taken against the offenders on social media platforms so that word can be spread for the awareness and the efficacy of animal protection. Share your story with us and other social media platforms that you might get together with.</li>
                <li>Be a part of the cause for fair practices that should be intended towards the environment and animals. We can only work and see a change if we join hands together, so that together we stand for the voices of the world around and within us.</li>
